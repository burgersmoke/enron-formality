Subject: RE: how was the curry?
********************************************

The best I've ever had in my whole entire life, anywhere in the world.

Seriously, I think the guests--including me--thought that it was fabulous. I know Prentice finished hers, so I assume she liked it.  Cameron......well, you'll have to ask her.

The mango chutney combined with the curry was, like, death raging, man.

Best,
Jeff
