Yes.  That would be good.  However, John and I have spoken and Dick Jenkins and I have spoken.  I have confirmation from both of these traders that the mechanism for the recall was to purchase the gas back at an agreed price, different from the sell price (creating multiple back-to-backs with Colonial).  Therefore, the way these items sit in our system seems correct.  Furthermore, I have left a message with Colonial's accountant (Fri May 11) on this stating our position and that they needed to work internally to determine if there should be a conversation between our marketers and their marketers.

I think it might be useful for you, Meredith, and I to sit down and talk about specific paths for these items, especially Dec/00.  At the very least that would help me put my ducks in a row when I am talking to Colonial about collection on Dec/00.  Under our current position Colonial owes us for Dec-00.  Wednesday is good for me.

Thanks.
