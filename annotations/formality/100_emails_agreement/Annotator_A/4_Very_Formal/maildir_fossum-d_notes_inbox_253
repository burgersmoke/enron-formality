Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with
FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its
922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide
additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for
firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate
Program, the company said.

"A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest
Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor
stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming,
restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.
