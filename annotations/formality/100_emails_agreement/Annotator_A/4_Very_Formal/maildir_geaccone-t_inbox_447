Subject: Revised Auction Item List
********************************************

Hi:

Here is the latest Auction Item List in Excel.  The list is sorted by
category. If you have trouble opening this attachment, send me what version
of Excel you have and I will resend it to you in that format, if possible.

I will be out of town on Thursday and Friday which is why I am sending this
report early.

I am also attaching a copy of the general solicitation letter in case you
need it.

Thanks,
Peggy Haney <<AUCTION ITEMS 110701.xls>>  <<solicitation letter 2002.doc>>
