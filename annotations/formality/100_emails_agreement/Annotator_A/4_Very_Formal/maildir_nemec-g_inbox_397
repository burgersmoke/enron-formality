Subject: Strategic Recruitment Survey
********************************************

For the First Half of 2001, EWS Recruiting Services has filled 546 open positions in our client businesses, and we don't plan on easing our efforts a bit. Our goal is to continue to improve our service to maximize alignment with the needs of our businesses.  We want to ensure that we move at the speed of Enron.  Please take a few moments to complete this brief 16-question survey to let us know how we're doing.

It should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.   All responses will be kept confidential.

Your opinions matter to us, so please take the time to reply today!

Regards,
Neil Davies
Director of Recruiting
