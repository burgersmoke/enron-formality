Subject: Re: Assumption and Assignment
********************************************

I have been out of town for the last few days. I understand that Sara is out
for the rest of this week.

After reviewing, I believe the Short Position Assignment Agreement form
(Goldman Sachs) you sent last week needs some slight revision (including
retitling it Assignment and Assumption Agreement), and will need to
appropriately refer to the current Corporate Account Agreement between ECT
Investments, Inc. and GS,  and the one between ENA and GS (is there a
Corporate Account Agreement between GS and ENA?). It seems to me that the
document should apply to both short and long positions in the brokerage
account. Sheila, do you agree?

Once we revise the GS form, we could create a similar draft version for
Morgan Stanley and one for Bear Stearns. Is this an acceptable way forward so
we can get you where you want to go?

Finally, I had understood that Sara, after checking with the credit desk, was
going to look into the issue of what internal documentation, if any, would be
appropriate for transferring the OTC derivative positions. We will need her
input on this when she gets back early next week.
