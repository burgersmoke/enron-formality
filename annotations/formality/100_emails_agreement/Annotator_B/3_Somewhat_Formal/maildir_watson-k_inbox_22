ICE Goes Public With Its Indices
IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), one of the fastest growing electronic commodity marketplaces, is going public with its daily natural gas and power price indices, making them available, free of charge, to anyone that registers at www.intercontinentalexchange.com. <http://www.intercontinentalexchange.com.> The company said its index history is also available.
"One of the key roles that any public market plays is to provide all interested parties with price transparency," said Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE CEO. "We are providing the marketplace with the type of fair and useful data that creates a more level playing field for all market participants."
Power price indices are reported for seven major U.S. trading hubs. Natural gas indices are reported for 18 hubs. The indices will include a daily high, low and weighted average, as well as total daily trade volume. The indices are based totally on electronic transactions that take place each morning on the ICE system for next day delivery. The indices are calculated and available the same day at noon CDT and immediately emailed to all subscribers.
ICE, which is in a race with several other trading platforms to capture the bulk of the electronic trading market, is continuing to grow with its system installed on over 5,200 desktops worldwide. Trading encompasses more than 600 listed contracts.
