Kay,

Based on our conversation it looks like Kinko's would be interested in purchasing approximately 8,800 MWh's per year for a three year term (approximately 26,500 MWh's) over the term of the deal.  Our offer price for Texas Renewable Energy Credits (sourced from within the State of Texas) would remain at $6.00 MWh.
