Subject: Re: "Project DoorStep" TARGET DATE
********************************************

The memo was written requesting that the name of the trading book not reflect Denver any longer.  There are several technical issues involved with the IT group which could make this difficult.  It is being looked at to see if it can be changed.  The memo at least documented the fact that this inconsistency exists and may be enough to suffice for the time being.
