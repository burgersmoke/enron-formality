Subject: Re: More cruise info
********************************************

Hi all,

Have been copied on the cruise email exchanges and agree with the July
time frame reminding all of Dad's usual July 4th Keewatin excursion,
important or not. Will attempt on my end to garnish feedback from
those I know who have made the same cruise. My cruise is going
remarkably well amidst Navy wargames etc.

See you all at Mom's retirement party!

Steve
