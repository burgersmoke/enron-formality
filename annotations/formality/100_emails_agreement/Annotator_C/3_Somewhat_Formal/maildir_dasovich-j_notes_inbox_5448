Subject: Re: Cal ISO Not Filing CM Proposal at FERC - EPMI Response?
********************************************

I see no downside to calling the question on California ISO Governance.  The
CAISO staff was ready to move forward on a proposal that was not too
inconsistent with the DStar and RTO West.  As a result, there was a good
chance that seams issues could be addressed before the other two RTOs start
up.  At  yesterday's Western Seams Task Force meeting, the California rep had
to make it clear that everything was on hold until the new political (my
words not his) board was educated.  In addition, the Governor has hired his
own consultants.  It was the California's understanding that the legislation
passed limits the ability of the CA-ISO to agree to any seams solutions
unless endorsed by California State Government.  The current situation seems
to guarantee a stalemate and put an enormous drag on all RTO development in
the West.  It won't get any better if we wait.  It would be better to
challenge now, before this new board starts making decisions based on
political expediency.
