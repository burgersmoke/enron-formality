Gerald,

The contact information for Assumption Parish is as follows:

Assumption Parish Police Jury

P.O. Box 524
Napoleonville, LA 70390

I have two changes that you may have already taken note of.  The first change is in the description of the property on the first page.  In the 8th line in the description, it says "the South property line a distance or 260.02..."  it should read "distance of 260.02".  This change also needs to be made in the description contained within Exhibit B.  In the description contained within Exhibit B, there should not be a period after the words "to the point of beginning" in the 10th line.

The second change is also in Exhibit B on page 2.   In the paragraph that starts "all parties signing the written instrument....", I don't think "marital status" should be in there.

One final thing, the purchase price for the warehouse and land is $100,000.

Give me a call if you have any questions.  Also, let me know if you need any help with the lawn-mowing agreement.

Thanks for your help.
