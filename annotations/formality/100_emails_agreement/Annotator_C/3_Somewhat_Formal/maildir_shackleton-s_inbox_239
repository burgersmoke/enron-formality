TO EGM LEGAL TEAM:
I have volunteered to be a Team leader for the annual Juvenile Diabetes Res=
earch Foundation Walk, which Mike McConnell is chairing for Enron's team th=
is year. The event is being held at Greenspoint Mall from 8am-noon on Sunda=
y, October 28. Please read the below e-mail message for further details. Th=
e walk is for three miles.
I would appreciate your team support either as a walker (with others financ=
ially supporting your efforts) or as a supporter of our legal team's walk. =
It would be great to have a strong showing of our legal team at the event i=
tself!
Please let Nita Garcia (x39559) know what support you can give to this very=
worthy cause by Monday, October 1. She will have at her desk the sign up s=
heets for walkers and the donation sign-up sheets.
Many thanks, Alan
