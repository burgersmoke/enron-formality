Please take a moment to relax your mind and humble your heart to focus on 
Christ. Allow God, to be the only person on your mind while you read this 
prayer. If we can take the time to read long jokes and stories, we 
should give the same respect to this prayer. Friends that pray together, 
stay together. 

 
 
Dear Lord, I thank You for this day.
 I thank You for my being able to see and to hear this morning. 
 I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an understanding God.
 You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me.  
 Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought that was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your forgiveness.  
 Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. 
 Help me to start this day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. 
 Let me make the best of each and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear from You. 
 Please broaden my mind so that I can accept all things. 
 Let me not whine and whimper about things over which I have no control.
 Let me continue to see sin through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil. And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my 
wrongdoing, and receive the forgiveness of God.  
 And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example-to slip away and find a quiet 
place to pray. It's the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. 
 I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart.  
 Continue to use me to do Your will.  
 Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to others. 
 Keep me strong that I may help the weak. 
 Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. 
 I pray for those that are lost and can't find their way.  
 I pray for those that are misjudged and misunderstood. 
 I pray for those who don't know You intimately. 
 I pray for those that don't believe. But I thank you that I believe.  
 I believe that God changes people and God changes things. 
 I pray for all my sisters and brothers and for each and every family member in their households.  I pray for peace, love and joy for each of them and that all their needs are met.  
 I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in Your hands  for You to fight. 
 I pray that these words be received into the hearts of every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.  
 This is my prayer.  In Jesus' Name, 
 Amen. 

. 
God Bless Each of You.
