hi.  how's things.  my cars getting fixed as we speak!  it'll be ready next 
tues/wed.  I'm very excited about going to the dome this weekend and looking 
forward to seeing you guys.  can you please bring annie with you?

one small request:  i'm pretty frazzled with work, school, etc. and am 
looking forward to relaxing and hanging out with you guys.  it would be great 
to talk about anything other than 1) the electricity crisis and 2) george w. 
bush.  i figure we can talk for hours about how to get the railing done on 
the deck!

best,
jeff
