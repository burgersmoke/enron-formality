Oh my god...I think I asked someone about you just last week. How weird is
that? Are you still in Houston??!! If so, did you survive the flood?
Yes, we're in Tampa--we are three now, including Saul(10 months). Actually, I
was in touch with Stefanie in the last year or so b/c her dad was my doctor.
I've always wondered how Sarah is doing. I heard she's living in San
Francisco and that she got married recently. Is that true? If you have her
e-mail, I'd love to be in touch with her.
What is Enron & what do you do there? By the way, what ever happened to Lisa
Schiffman?
I still work for Hillel(going on 10 years!). I do fundraising in
Sarasota($$$)and work with a few campuses across Florida that need jumpstarts
for their Hillel/Jewish student groups. Brian has a job with a small(250
family) congregation here. We'll be here for at least 5 more years, through
his next contract. We built a great house which I never want to leave. Saul
is lots of fun!
It's really great to hear from you. Please fill me in on the past several
years of your life.
Best,
Mimi
