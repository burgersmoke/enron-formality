The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.  She really isn't a great 
seamstress.  I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet, 
Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened.  
Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and 
said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used 
them.   I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress 
for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and 
does a great job.  Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off 
Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.   She is an absolute 
sweetheart.  I don't give her name out to a whole lot of people because I 
don't want to get her too busy or too expensive (I'm so selfish!).  Only to 
my select, special friends!
