Hi Sara,
Attached are the changes you requested.  Shall I begin confirming all 
Allegheny deals on this form until the ISDA is complete?

Thanks for your help!

Hi Sara,
Ok, I think I have properly referenced the side letter in this confirmation.  
Please let me know what changes should be made.

P.S. I am leaving at noon today, so if I haven't heard from you by then, I 
will give you a call tomorrow morning.
Thanks!
