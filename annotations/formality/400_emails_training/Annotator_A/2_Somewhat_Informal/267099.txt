Hi, Geoff,

I know that you are busy, so I will send you an e-mail instead of trying to
reach you by phone...

Just a few quick questions for you:

1.   Box 13, Code "C" for $36.00 on your W-2 - is this your donation to the
United Way?

2.  Please confirm that you donated $533 to the German Shephard Dog Rescue
and paid $533 at closing for real estate taxes.  I just want to make sure
that it is a coincidence that these amounts are the same, and not a typing
error.

3.  Please confirm that you paid $3,133.88 for your Tibco International
Inc. shares and sold at $2,905.09, and paid $9,355.00 for your Nasdaq
shares and sold at $7,459.75 (both sold at a loss).


Thank you kindly,

Vicki Meszaros
