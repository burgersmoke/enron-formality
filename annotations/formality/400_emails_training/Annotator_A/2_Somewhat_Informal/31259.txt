This is David Lasater's resume.  David grew up in Houston, got his PhD from
UT, taught at Michigan State, and has been in our NYC office for about 13
or 14 years.  He is an effective testifier and has been involved in a
number of securities cases.

I saw the complaint this morning shortly after we spoke.  If you would like
to brainstorm or if we can assist you in any way, pls do not hesitate to
give us a call.

Rgds

Dean
