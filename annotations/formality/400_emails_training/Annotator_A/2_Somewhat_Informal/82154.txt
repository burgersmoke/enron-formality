I had not seen it yet.  Do you have my other employees rankings?  Since they reccomend that the PRC Representative be involved in providing feedback, would you like to do that next week when you are here?

Mark

I assume you received this information already and I know that we have not discussed Tyrell being ranked here.  The #1 spot was tightly held by only a few people ( in the americas and as such everyone was moved down... Although the forced ranking creates problems at time, I am satisfied that Ty's ranking is appropriate... 

let's discuss, BT

Below are the final PRC rankings for the Analysts and /or Associates who were assigned to you for the mid-year PRC process.  Please communicate these results to the appropriate supervisor.  PRC reviews with the Analysts and Associates should be completed by early August, and the signed evaluation forms should be returned to me at EB3539b.  The Program recommends that if asked, the supervisor should provide the actual ranking to the Analyst or Associate.  In addition, we recommend that the PRC representative be involved in providing feedback to the Analyst or Associate.


Name	PRC Level	BU	Hire Date	Supervisor	Ranking	Promotion	
Harrison, Tyrell  G	Analyst-2	ENA	2/1/1999	Mr. Mark Whitt	2	No	
Polsky, Philip  D.	Associate	ENA	8/7/2000	Mr. Barry L Tycholiz	3	No	


Thank you for your participation in this important process.
