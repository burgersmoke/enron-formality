Subject: your deck project
********************************************

Hello Jeff,

We're winding down a large project , about two more weeks, and preping
to begin another, but we should have a small window of opportunity to
get to your project, if you're still interested in having us do the
work.

So we need to meet or I need more info from you to get a good idea of
exactly what you want.

Please let me know.

Thank you!

Jim Docker
