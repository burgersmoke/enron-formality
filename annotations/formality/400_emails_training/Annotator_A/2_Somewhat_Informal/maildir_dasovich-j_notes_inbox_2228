Jeff, when you get the description, just go to the bottom of the page and hit
continue, then your election form will appear and when you get to the bottom
of that form, click accept and then you will be able to print your
confirmation statement.  Also, if you prefer to print the form before
entering your information, you can do so from the bottom of the page.
Sometimes people, for whatever reason, can't see the whole screen, so they
can't see the buttons "I Accept"  or "Continue" or "Print" and then they have
to go to the display settings if maximizing the screen doesn't help.  Let me
know if none of this works for you or you can call me at 713-853-5878 and
I'll walk you through it.

Thanks.

Mary
