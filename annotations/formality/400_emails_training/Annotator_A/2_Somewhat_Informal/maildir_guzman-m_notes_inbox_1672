Subject: Sunday Palo Verde Preschedules
********************************************

On Friday night we discovered that the planned maintenance at Palo Verde for
Sunday was  a "go" again.     The cash traders/preschedulers had been told
that the work was cancelled.

R. Slinger and Leaf rerouted 150mw's of onpeak energy  that was routed/tagged
to go to the PX,   saving the company $48,096.   The PX cleared for zero's
much of the onpeak hours, as there was major cong. at PV.    They sold to LA
directly 100 mw's and also booked out 50mw's with the generator (TEP) of one
of the preschedules.    Our desk retained the majority of the savings, as
indicated below.

This was a good exercise,   as it demonstrates how we can "jump chain" on
certain curtailed paths and settle directly with the generator's to avoid
inadvertancy.
This was done and the system balanced perfectly.

Good job!!
