********************************************

Hey (insert name here),

Thank you for your response, it's very nice to meet you!  By the way, my name is Tracy or you can call me tp081996, ha ha!  So, what was it about me that caught your attention anyway?  Have you dated many women off of the Internet?  What has been your best/worst dating experience?  Are you originally from CO or elsewhere?  Please tell me a little more about yourself as I'm interested in getting to know you!

Take care,

Tracy

2.  REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURES which may include your personal contact information.

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address (in the From: field), so that it will NOT appear in the "From:" line. However, DO NOT use the "Cc:" or "Bcc:" fields as these addresses CANNOT be stripped away.
