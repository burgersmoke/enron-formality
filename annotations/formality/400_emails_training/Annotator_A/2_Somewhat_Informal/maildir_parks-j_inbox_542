Subject: feeder motors
********************************************

Chris and Kieth: Thought cam to me after I talked to you guys regarding
BOOGER motor. Chris, was that spincast the one with the bent up aluminum
housing on the inside??? If it is, that is the one that I sent to get
repaired. I have a feeling that it is not. I think it might be the motor
that was at the mesquite flat last year. If it is, that motor has a week
spin motor and occationally would get stuck by slight resistance from corn,
but the clock would still work fine. If that is the one that is now at
booger, pulling the guts and replacing it will do nothing. It is the spin
motor that needs to be replaced. If it is the one that is all muddy, it is
the one that was at gray box last year and got trashed by the coons at the
end of last year. It looked like it was working, but apparently is not.

Talk to each other and see if you can figure out which one it is.

Doing a count of feeders, I think there is still one Magnum black photo box
in the trailer and I know there are two green tubes. I think our best option
may be to put a magunum on booger with a conversion (free) and shelf the
spincast or confirm what is wrong with it before we dump more $ into another
one of those piece of shit motors.

Please advise on your thoughts. e.
