Thank you for your message.  I had a good day yesterday eating at Brennan's,
manicure, shopping, drinking with friends, etc.
Now the fun has ended and the rest of my life working begins.  I don't know
how I feel about that.

Have a good day!  Talk to you soon.  Is the Marathon this weekend?  If so,
good luck.  I wouldn't want to say "break a leg."
