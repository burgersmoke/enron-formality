Just wanted to let you know I appreciated Mary's effort in turning this
around so quickly even though her workload was quite heavy due to the KCS
VPP.  The situation was not handled very well prior to it landing on her desk
(which we can discuss if you are interested), but true to form, Mary saved
the day.

Thanks,
Tanya
