I saw a story on Enron's 4Q results and subsequent stock gain yesterday.
All I could think about was Ted once again taking the opportunity to bug you
about buying a new car.  I'm guessing the jump in your stock price yesterday
makes that convertible Jag look a lot better.

I guess you're in Key West right now...wow, in the Keys and working for a
company who's stock is going up...I'm jealous.

Have a good time.
