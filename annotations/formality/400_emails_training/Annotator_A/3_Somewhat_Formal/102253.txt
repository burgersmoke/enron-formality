Steve,

I am Mark's paralegal.  Why don't you go ahead and fax that agreement to me 
at (713) 646-3490 and it will get the agreement signed and faxed it back to 
you.  What is your fax number?

    Mark,

    Thanks for the response.  Apparently the meeting is tomorrow, and we have
missed the FedEx deadline for today.  Shall I fax the signed NDA to you so 
that
the meeting can go forward, and FedEx 2 originals to you for formal signature
processing?

    Steve
