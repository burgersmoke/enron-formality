Tana,

The below deal is up for settlement now.  Was an assignment agreement done?  
If not, can we get one done now?  Coral doesn't want to settle it as Coral 
Energy Resources.

Thanks,
Joe

Tana,

Coral has blundered again.  Deal NZ1738 traded 9/13 was done under Coral 
Energy Resources, L.P.  rather than Coral Energy Holding, L.P.

Can you put together another Assignment Agreement?

Thanks,
Joe
