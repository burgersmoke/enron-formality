If you cannot attend the Walk, please support one of your local walkers, participate in the cyber auction or join us for the Big E Caf? on Friday to participate in some of our other great fundraising activities.  We want to keep our standing as the number one walk team in the Gulf Coast area, Texas, and the entire Southern Region of the U.S., as well as in the top 10 nationally.
