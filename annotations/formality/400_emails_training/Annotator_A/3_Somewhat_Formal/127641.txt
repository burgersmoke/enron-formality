I attach the latest stats for the website. We are still getting an average of 
over 500 visitors per day, with an average stay of about 11 minutes.



I also attach links to the proposed additions to the website for this month.

We are adding two new educational sections describing risk management and 
weather derivatives and a new calculator to give consumers an ability to 
calculate how much their electricity costs will increase as fuel prices 
increase. We have also improved the navigation around the site.

A feature article comparing the dereg experience in the telecom sector and 
the tactics used by the incumbent monopoly NTT with the electricity sector 
will follow shortly.

kind regards

Subject: Website Changes

This is a list of changes to the website which will go into production early 
next week. The graphics in the text on the new pages are temporary to provide 
an idea of content for the purpose of internal content review. In addition, 
graphics for new links on the top page and a few features intended to improve 
ease of use are currently under development and are represented by empty 
boxes in the appropriate areas on screen. 

I would be grateful if you would review the new pages for content and provide 
feedback.

After review, the Japanese text (almost complete) and graphics will be added 
and the new graphics will be added for testing next Monday.
