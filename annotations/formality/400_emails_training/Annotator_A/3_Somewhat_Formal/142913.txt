I'm in good shape now.  Just a little left for today.

Is Ric getting sentimental?  Losing someone can make you feel that way, even 
if it isn't logical.

We'll just get through this day and start over tomorrow.

Bruce probably hasn't heard from Nick yet.  I'll check again tomorrow.  When 
will you know when you are going to NY?  Sunday?

If you need help with a document, say something, I can help you (stay late 
whatever).  That's what I'm here for.  I figured something was up and I'm 
hormonal, so I've just stayed to myself today.

Ric emailed me about whether to pay his mother's, brother's and sister's way 
down for his birthday.  Now, he never hears from his sister and hardly ever 
hears from his brother except when he sends him his monthly payment that he 
owes him and that's just a check.  I told him to bring his mother down and 
the others can fend for themselves.  I was afraid I would hurt his feelings, 
but he said he felt the same way.  I will not have anyone taking advantage of 
him.  I'd be the same way with my brother if I never talked to him.  Emma 
wouldn't be nearly as spoiled as she is!!!!  Can you tell I'm hormonal, I'm 
just bitching away.  

Are you ok now with your document?

Thanks for checking.  I'm on message 7 of 9, and don't have anything from 
Bruce.

Sorry I was cranking this am.  I got here at 600am, mostly because I had 
problems with a document which had to go out today.  

Kay

Have you heard from Bruce Silvers?  He called and left me a voicemail that he 
was free all day Monday, but he was checking with Nick Palatin.  I haven't 
heard any more from him and was wondering if he called you.  Just following 
up.
