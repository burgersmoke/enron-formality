The lenders have specifically asked for an original of the Letter Agreement.
If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them
again if they will accept a copy.  I appreciate that there are only 2
parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter
Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to
have an original.  Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6
originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have
originals.

I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that
this request has come so late in the day.

Regards
Isabel

Isabel:

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.

The lenders have informed us that they would also like to have at least one
original of the GE Guaranty.
Please let us know whether this will be possible.  In addition, could you
please let us know how many originals of the Letter Agreement were signed?
The lenders also need an original of this document.

Thank you in advance
Isabel
