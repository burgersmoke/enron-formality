  those credited to your account from June 1 through June 30, 2001.
  Stays/nights credited during May and July are not reflected on
  this statement. However, Starpoints earned for May stays may
  appear on your statement due to the additional processing time

  stays, or meals not in conjunction with eligible room rates, do not
  count toward your number of nights/stays.
