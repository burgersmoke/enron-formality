The contract was mailed to Molly yesterday(9/11/00).  Let me know if she 
doesn't get it by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Susan,

We are getting very close to the start up of the Bazor Ridge plant.. When I
talked to you Friday, you were going to request that Stacy "generate the
paper".  Has this been done yet?  The invoicing does not appear to be an
issue any more, our controller would like us to invoice Enron and Rebel to
invoice EOTT on all products.  Also, I am assuming that you changed the
September pricing to Gas Daily, as you implied below, on August 25.  Right
now we are looking at a start up on the last 10 days or so of September.

If there are problems with any of the above, please call me a soon as you
can today at (601)969-1568.  I will be out the rest of the week.  If
anything comes up after today please contact Dan Cole at the same number.

Thank you,

Stevens

Stevens-

I've been trying to get in touch with our attorney Stacy Dickson to see if
the confirmation is signed.  The last version of the confirmation reflected
gas daily pricing for August and index pricing for Sept, Oct and Nov.  I
think we will need to amend this if the time periods are going to be
different.

I'll let you know when I hear back from Stacy.

Susan

Susan,

As I understand it (which could be dangerous), if it comes on in 1st, 2nd
week of September we have to use Gas Daily, is this correct?  Our comtract
calls for the time period to be 3 months, after the 1st day following the
first month of production.  This would carry the contract through,
December.

Also, the operator of Destin pipeline is still telling the operator of the
well that Enron does not have a shipping agreement in place.  I have told
them that Enon is telling us they are ready to recieve.

Stevens

Stevens-

Do you want to change the contract to reflect Gas Daily pricing for
September and Inside FERC pricing effective Oct & Nov?

EOTT driver training has been rescheduled for the mornings of 9/5 and 9/6.
DuFore driver training has been rescheduled to the afternoon of 9/5.  I
expect to have residue gas for sale between 9/2 and 9/6, depending on how
well plant commissioning goes.

Let me know if you require any additional information.
