Jacques,

Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to 
support the $15,000.  As you will read below, it is no longer an issue.  I 
think that was the last issue to resolve. 

Phillip

Phillip, the title company held the $15,000 in escrow and it has been
returned. It is no longer and issue.

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the
closing statement or on some other document.

Phillip
