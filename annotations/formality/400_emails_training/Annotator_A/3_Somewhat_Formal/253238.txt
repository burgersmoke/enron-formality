Andy,

Here is my understanding of what was agreed to last Thursday and Friday with Kiodex.  You will notice that there a couple of Open Issues you are probably best able to respond to.  Before forwarding this document to Kiodex and using it as a basis for a formal legal Co-Marketing document, we may also want to consider one further review by Travis McCullough, Mark Taylor, Louise Kitchen, and Jay Webb.  Let me know your thoughts and comments.
