Hi Cheryl,

I'm not sure if I forwarded this or not, but I'm not sure what to do with this.  This is regarding the invoice I gave you a couple weeks ago.  It appears that Stan submitted two invoiced on the same day?  Let me know if there is anything I can do.  

Cooper

Cooper --  I received payment for invoice  #001 a couple of days after I asked you.  Thank you very much.. Not to  appear greedy but I have not received payment for # 002 which was submitted on  Nov 29 and again after Xmas with the # 001 documentation. # 002 is for  $1712.00 and covers work I did at the end of August to develop the plant  coefficents forwarded to you on Nov 29.  Please see what you can do &  let me know. Stan
