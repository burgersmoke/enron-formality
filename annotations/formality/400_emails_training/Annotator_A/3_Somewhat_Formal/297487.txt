Louise - Current status on Drift expense allocations....  We have reviewed the $11.8 million in question and that amount is correct given the methodology being used by Gary to allocate costs.  When Gary is back in the office on Thursday, I will go through his allocations with him to determine if we need to change that methodology and thus change the allocation percentages.  I will let you know the outcome of that meeting.

Also, keep in mind that the $11.8 million represents a Plan amount.  Actuals should be much less since we are currently well under Plan headcount amounts and not all Plan expenses have been made.  Let me know if you have any questions - I will keep you updated.

Regards,

Brent

Brent, 

Mike and I have discussed the Drift plan and clearly there was an allocation issue somewhere along the line.  Please let us have our new numbers.

Thanks
