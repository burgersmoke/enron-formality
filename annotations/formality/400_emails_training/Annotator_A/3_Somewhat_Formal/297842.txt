MEXICO'S NATURAL GAS: WHY HASN'T A SPOT MARKET DEVELOPED?
Current regulation allows Mexico to develop a transparent import and export spot market; however, despite the reform, Pemex continues to be the key player, not only supplying natural gas but also controlling sales contracts with most users. The key question is, why hasn't the spot market developed? Some of the reasons are:

* flaw in the current price methodology

* a lack of price transparency in transportation

* price deals offered by Pemex
