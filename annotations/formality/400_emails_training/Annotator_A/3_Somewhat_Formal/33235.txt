Richard-

I just wanted to follow up on my requests attached below.  Additionally, we 
haven't received a response from Gibbs & Bruns.  This isn't a problem right 
now as we are still probably at least a week away from signing an opinion.  I 
just wanted to keep you informed.  Let me know if I can send someone up to 
get copies of the documents.  Thanks for your help.


Russ

Richard-

I have two requests that I hope you can help me with.  First, I wanted to see 
if there was an executed document removing Intrust.  If there is, I would 
like to get a copy of that.  Also, you mentioned a "side letter" agreement 
drawn up to allow the GPs to have the right to remove Intrust.  I would also 
like to get a copy of that document.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
