OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look 
for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will 
present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the 
most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have 
them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout 
is as follows:

 Group1   Group2
 Carole    Jennifer
 Jason    Anne
 Chris   

Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 
11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.
