We have been given an opportunity to come in on Sunday, November 18th from 2-6 pm to test applications.  If you feel that someone in your group needs to come in please  advise who that person will be.  We are limited to one person per region.

I need to get this information to Heather Choate ASAP.

Thanks for your help.

Suzanne and Clarissa-being that your managers are out can you make this call?
