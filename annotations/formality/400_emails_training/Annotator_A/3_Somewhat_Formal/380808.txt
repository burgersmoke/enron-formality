Don,

Below is the information that I need from Arch Wireless to have Enron up and
running on the pager system for Vermont Yankee.

Contact Properties:
Contact Name - I'm assuming that's going to be you.  If you are not going to
be holding the pager at all times then we may want to have a generic contact
name.
Pager ID/Pin:	8774946661 (Please verify if I need to use all 10 digits -
do I need hyphens?)
Carrier Name:
Phone Number:	This needs to be a 800 or 888 number.
Max Characters: ?
Service Type:	Alpha or Numeric
Baud Rate:	?
Settings:	?
We use AirSource Pro Software and the modem settings are as follows:

Gateway Telepath Modem
Commands:	AT&F&K0&N0E0X4

The modem commands are not carrier specific so I need the command string to
be compatible with the following carriers:

Rinkers
CVC Paging
Arch
Contact

The backup system we've put in place has the following modem settings:

Gateway 2000 Telepath II Fax Modem
AT&C1&D2&K0&M0&N1Q0V1

I hope this helps regarding the information.  Hope it's not too
overwhelming.
Please contact me at (802) 258-4120 or via email if you have any questions.
Thanks again for your help.  I'd like to have this up and runner by the end
of next week.

Take Care,
