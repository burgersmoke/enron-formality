This will get you access to multiple Henwood services. 
The one that gives the plant performance stats is 
GenReporter, and you navigate it more or less the same 
way that you use our plant database: dropdown lists 
subset the plants by region, owner, type, etc. Once you 
see a list of plants, click on unit name for more data.

Please call if you have problems,
Tim
