Please review these deal numbers with LADWP to determine if we should be delivering.  Houston lists us as having a $279k MTM position on an index deal (that seems counter intuitive unless we paid up front for some sort of basis swap, or they are gas-indexed). They apparently deliver at Mead 230 and Palo Verde.  Any light that can be shed on these would be helpful.

Steve,

Ed asked me to send you the deal numbers for LA Water & Power.  They are index-forward deals that settle against different indices.  Please check into the deals and let us know if we need to be scheduling these.

867350.01
867350.02
408250.01
408250.02
408250.03

Thanks.

- Nick
