Harry, Janine, & Bob --

Joe Short works on Project Phoenix (rebooking of old EES deals).  He is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the Simon Properties deal with the Master Meter issue.  

If anyone has any old files on this, please send his way.  Also, any updates on where we stand (e.g., Ohio court cases) would be good.  

We probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal.  After we get Joe our info, we can regroup to determine next steps.

Thanks.  If anyone has any questions, please call.

Jim
