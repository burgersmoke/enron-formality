********************************************


Renee,

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

Phillip
