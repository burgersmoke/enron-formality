Whittney:

The internships are slated to last from 10 to 12 weeks.  If you are able to
complete 10 weeks, there will not be a problem.  We actually had the same
problem with candidates last year.  Please just indicate your date
considerations on your offer letter so that HR knows you will not be here a
full 12 weeks.  As long as we know in advance, there should not be a problem.

Thank you so much!
