Subject: El Paso FR conf. scheduled
********************************************

The notice announcing the public conference on El Paso's Full Requirements
capacity allocation was issued and is attached.  The conference will be
held on April 16 at 10:00 a.m.

The notice contains a reference to the Staff's proposal and a description
of such.  The only "discussion paper" available is the power point
presentation made at the March 13th open Commission meeting, which I am
also attaching.  To note, during the discussion at that meeting it was
indicated that this may be a Commissioner-level conference.
