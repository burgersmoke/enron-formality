Tana,

Pursuant to my conversations with NYPA, we have agreed to move forward
without the collateral annex.  In leau of this, we will need to have the MAC
(downgrade event) established as an Event of Default versus a collateral
event.  As well, change the 3rd party default for both ENA and NYPA from
$50MM to $100MM.  Please call with comments or questions.
