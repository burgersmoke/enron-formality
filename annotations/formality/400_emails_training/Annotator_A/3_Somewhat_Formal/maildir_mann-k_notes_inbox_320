Subject: RE: Extension letter
********************************************

Kay -- Do you know if David H. is going to give you comments?  If you haven't
heard for sure, one of us will call Marvin and find out/coordinate.  Just
don't want to call if this has already been discussed with them.

Is there anything else at this stage that we can do to help your efforts on
the Extension or the main agreement?

Thanks  -- David
