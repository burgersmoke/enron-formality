Subject: Raptor Swaps
********************************************

The attached swaps will be delivered by hard copy batch, together with the
revised proposal sheets and another copy of the legal worksheets, to Julia
Chin on Monday morning.  Julia suggested due to the floor move on 27 that I
wait until first thing Monday to have the batched execution versions
delivered to her.  Upon receipt, Julia will attach the valuation data that
has been previously provided to her by Hope Vargas and coordinate execution.
Michael Galvan and Anne Koehler are working together on final Active Power
proposals sheets.  The Active Power swaps will be drafted after the final
proposal sheet has been approved by both Michael and Anne.  As and when
Proposal Sheets are provided on the privates we will commence drafting the
private swaps.
