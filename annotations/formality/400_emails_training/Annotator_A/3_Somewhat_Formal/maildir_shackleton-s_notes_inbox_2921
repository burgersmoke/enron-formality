Subject: Mirant Guarantee
********************************************

I just spoke with Mirant's attorney, David Fields.  Two originals of the
guaranty are being sent to us; we should sign both and return one original to
Mirant.  The other should be kept for our files.  Mirant is not interested in
receiving a signed version of the fax back, so just wait for the originals to
arrive before getting any signatures.  Finally, David told me that James
Ward, who signed the guarantee is Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
of Mirant Corporation.  You might want to confirm this with Nicole Russell
since Mirant's home page on the net lists him as Senior Vice President,
Finance and Accounting.  Thanks.
