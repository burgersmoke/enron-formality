Subject: Draft of October Event Invitation
********************************************

We have combined everyone's input and here is where we are thus far.  We are
targeting Friday, 9/21 for mail out of the invitations.  The initial
invitation will not have the steering committee members listed, due to
timing of the mail out.  A second mail out is scheduled for two weeks prior
to the event.  The second mail out will include the steering committee
members.  please forward your comments to my attention as soon as possible.

Thank you for your input,
