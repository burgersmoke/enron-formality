Mark,

Lyndon Taylor suggested that I send you my resume (attached).  I appreciate
your consideration of it.  I am very interested in a position at Enron.  I
am working mainly on domestic power projects at Coastal, but also work on
some international projects.  I have been a lawyer for ten years, and have
significant deal experience.  I also have an MBA, and speak five languages.

Lyndon said that you would mention my name to Kristina Mordaunt.  I very
much appreciate that also.

I look forward to speaking with you.  I can be reached at 713-418-4705.

Best regards,

Tariq
