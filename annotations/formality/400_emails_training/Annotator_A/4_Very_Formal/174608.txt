Hello Mark.  Attached is the latest version of the DASH as of late Friday 
afternoon.  I am initialling this version and faxing it to you now so that 
you will have it on Monday.  Neither the deal team nor I have any further 
comments to it, but if I learn when I arrive in SF on Monday that any further 
changes have been made, I will review, re-initial and send to you.  I am also 
tracking down the appendices referenced in the DASH, which I have reviewed in 
earlier draft form.

Pager No. for me on Monday is (800)316-0430;  SF office number is 
(415)782-7800.

Best regards,
Karen
