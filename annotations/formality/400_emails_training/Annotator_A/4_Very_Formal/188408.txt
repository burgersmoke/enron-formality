Rod,

It was a pleasure to meet you at the Birthday Party for Wendy Cherubini on
Friday, November 17th at the Woodlands Athletic Center. I found our
conversation to be enjoyable and informative.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how Thompson
Consulting my be of service to Enron. We offer a broad range of professional
services that I am sure Enron would find of value.

Please let me know when would be best for us to meet and I would try to
accommodate your requirement. If there are others you feel should join us in
the meeting please feel free to invite them and let me know.


Fred Thompson, PE
