Subject: LA and open access
********************************************

11/21. The Los Angeles  City Council adopted a resolution pertaining to
access to  broadband cable Internet access facilities. The resolution was
sponsored by Alex  Padilla, and adopted unanimously. It does not mandate
open  access; rather, it is a collection of policy positions regarding  open
access, and an instruction to the City Attorney to promote them  in
proceedings before the FCC, FTC and CPUC. A draft copy of the  resolution
reads, in part: "RESOLVE that the City Attorney is hereby  instructed and
authorized to represent the City in any rulemaking or  other proceedings
before the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the  California Public Utility
Commission, or any other proceedings that  relate to Internet transmission
over cable facilities in a manner  that encourages results consistent with
this Resolution." See, Los  Angeles City Council Agenda for Nov. 21, at Item
No 9.
